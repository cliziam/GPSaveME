#**GPSaveME**
 
Our objective was initially to develop a mobile application, in particular an Android
application, which would allow the users to send and receive help requests of any kind
of type (which not including the ones that require the police or 911 intervention).
The application would use a GPS positioning system for the purpose of visualizing the
help requests of other users nearby.
The help requests managed by our application would be traceable to a low or middle
risk and classifiable on three levels of priority: high, middle and low. To ensure the
completion of the help request by another user, we thought to use the NFC technology
in order to guarantee more safety on the connection.
To promote the utilization of the mobile application, we thought about a reward system,
based on the own of coins to be spent by the users to ask for help and to be accumulated
by them when they offer and succeed to give help to other users.
