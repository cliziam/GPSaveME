# **GPSaveME**

**GPSaveME** is an Android application, which allows the users to send and receive help requests of any kind of type (which not including the ones that require the police or 911 intervention).<br>
The application uses a GPS positioning system for the purpose of visualizing the help requests of other users nearby.<br>
The help requests managed is traceable to a low or middle risk and classifiable on three levels of priority: high, middle and low. <br>
To ensure the completion of the help request by another user, the app uses the NFC technology in order to guarantee more safety on the connection.<br>
In addition, to promote the utilization of the mobile application there is a reward system based on the own of coins to be spent by the users to ask for help and to be accumulated by them when they offer and succeed to give help to other users.
